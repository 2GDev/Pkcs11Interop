Pkcs11Interop implements full PKCS#11 v2.20 specification with the following 
mostly temporary exceptions and limitations:
 
 - Reading value of CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE and CKA_UNWRAP_TEMPLATE attributes 
   is supported only in LowLevelAPIs.
 - Locking related types CK_CREATEMUTEX, CK_DESTROYMUTEX, CK_LOCKMUTEX 
   and CK_UNLOCKMUTEX are not supported, but native OS threading model 
   (CKF_OS_LOCKING_OK) can be used without any problems.
 - CK_NOTIFY notification callbacks are not supported.

Pkcs11Interop implements full PKCS#11 URI specification with the following 
known limitations:

 - As recommended by PKCS#11 URI specification Pkcs11UriBuilder class 
   percent-encodes the whole value of the "id" attribute which is supposed 
   to be handled as arbitrary binary data. Therefore it is not possible to 
   construct URIs with arbitrary string value of the "id" attribute.
 - Validation of each individual attribute value is performed by the setter 
   of corresponding Pkcs11UriBuilder class property with the exception to 
   UnknownPathAttributes and UnknownQueryAttributes properties whose values 
   are validated when ToString() or ToPkcs11Uri() method is called.
