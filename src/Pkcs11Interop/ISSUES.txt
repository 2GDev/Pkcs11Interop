Pkcs11Interop implements full PKCS#11 v2.20 specification with following 
mostly temporary exceptions/limitations:
 
 - Pkcs11Interop works with .NET Framework 2.0 or higher on MS Windows (32-bit 
   and 64-bit) and also with Mono on Linux (32-bit) and Mac OS X (32-bit). 
   It may not work with Mono on Linux (64-bit).
 - Reading value of CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE and CKA_UNWRAP_TEMPLATE attributes 
   is supported only in LowLevelAPI.
 - Locking related types CK_CREATEMUTEX, CK_DESTROYMUTEX, CK_LOCKMUTEX 
   and CK_UNLOCKMUTEX are not supported, but native OS threading model 
   (CKF_OS_LOCKING_OK) can be used without any problems.
 - CK_NOTIFY notification callbacks are not supported.
