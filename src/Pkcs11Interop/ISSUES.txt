Pkcs11Interop implements full PKCS#11 v2.20 specification with the following 
mostly temporary exceptions and limitations:
 
 - Reading value of CKA_WRAP_TEMPLATE and CKA_UNWRAP_TEMPLATE attributes 
   is supported only in LowLevelAPIs.
 - Locking related types CK_CREATEMUTEX, CK_DESTROYMUTEX, CK_LOCKMUTEX 
   and CK_UNLOCKMUTEX are not supported, but native OS threading model 
   (CKF_OS_LOCKING_OK) can be used without any problems.
 - CK_NOTIFY notification callbacks are not supported.
